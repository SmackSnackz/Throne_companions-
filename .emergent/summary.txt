<analysis>
The AI engineer (E1) successfully transformed the Throne Companions application from a basic scaffold into a feature-rich MVP. Initial efforts focused on comprehensive UI/UX enhancements, including dynamic image backdrops for companions, correct logo placement, and removal of boilerplate. This was followed by a critical integration of AI-powered conversational responses using  and a custom system prompt framework for distinct companion personalities. E1 then built a multi-step compliance flow, a robust subscription tier system with server-side gating, and a guided onboarding sequence. Finally, E1 laid the groundwork for advanced analytics by implementing a metrics dashboard and initiating Mixpanel integration. Troubleshooting involved resolving React routing issues and refining backend logic for AI integration and content delivery. The current state has all major features implemented, but the tier selection buttons in the onboarding flow are not yet fully functional.

<product_requirements>
The Throne Companions application aims to provide AI companions with distinct personalities and tiered access to features.

**Product Features Implemented:**
1.  **Enhanced UI/Display:** Corrected overlapping text, stabilized layouts, applied consistent branding colors, fonts, and spacing.
2.  **Branding:** Incorporated the  sigil in the landing page header.
3.  **Companion Avatars:** Implemented full-size backdrop images (, , ) for companions on the  grid and  pages, ensuring full heads/bodies are visible without cropping.
4.  **Content Cleanup:** Removed all Emergent branding and placeholder names (Zara/Nova).
5.  **AI-Powered Conversations:** Replaced hard-coded companion responses with GPT-4o-mini via  library, enabling dynamic, personality-driven chat.
6.  **Enhanced System Prompts:** Implemented a detailed system prompt framework to define companion personalities (Sophia: Wise Counselor, Aurora: Creative Catalyst, Vanessa: Intuitive Confidante), manage conversation memory, and enforce natural conversation flow.
7.  **User Entry Compliance:** A multi-step onboarding compliance flow including:
    *   Age Verification (18+ checkbox)
    *   Terms of Service & Privacy Policy (scrollable agreement with I Agree button)
    *   DMCA / Content Policy (statement, prohibited content, takedown request details, acknowledgment).
8.  **Subscription Tiers:** Implemented four tiers: Novice (Free), Apprentice (9), Regent (9), and Sovereign (9), each with specific memory retention, allowed features (text, voice, visuals, finance), prompting mastery, and response styles. Server-side gating enforces tier restrictions, prompting upgrade CTAs.
9.  **Guided Onboarding Sequence:** A 5-minute flow for new users: Welcome Screen, Compliance Flow, Companion Selection, Tier Selection, First Guided Chat (with tier-specific intro/ritual), and a First Success Moment (actionable ritual within 3 exchanges).
10. **Content Starter Packs:** Preloaded each companion with tier-aware intro scripts and rituals, delivered on first chat and as fallbacks for unclear input.
11. **Metrics & Dashboard:** Implemented a backend analytics pipeline to track key events like signups, onboarding steps, first chat, ritual delivery, message sent, upgrade CTAs, feature usage, safety events, and LLM performance. API endpoints for an executive dashboard are available.
12. **Mixpanel Integration:** Initiated integration to track user behavior for real-time insights into funnels, cohorts, and feature adoption.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's feedback regarding the non-functional Select Plan buttons on the  page within the onboarding flow. The user explicitly stated that clicking any plan, including the free Novice plan, does not proceed into onboarding or chat.

The AI engineer acknowledged the issue and had begun investigating and making edits to the frontend components responsible for tier selection and onboarding flow management. Specifically, recent tool calls indicate modifications to:
-   : This file is crucial for rendering the tier cards and handling the selection logic. The problem was identified as buttons lacking proper click handlers.
-   : This component orchestrates the entire onboarding sequence and manages state transitions between steps. Edits were being made here to ensure the flow progresses correctly after tier selection.
-   : This file also contributes to the display and interaction with tier cards.

The user's last direct instruction regarding the code was: E1 u are obligated to fix all technical issues. Please fix all click buttons immediately, followed by Is it fixed if not,do so and Continue after the AI engineer reviewed . This indicates that the fixing of the tier selection buttons is the immediate, ongoing task, and its completion has not yet been confirmed. The problem persists where selecting a tier does not advance the user through the onboarding process.

<optional_next_step>
Continue debugging and fixing the functionality of the Select Plan buttons in the onboarding flow to ensure that selecting any tier correctly proceeds the user.
